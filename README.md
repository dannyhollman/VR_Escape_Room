## About
Jump into VR Escape Room and explore a futuristic sci-fi environment! Search the world around you and gather clues to advance through puzzles.
## Story
This was my first room-scale VR project using the Oculus integration package.  This project provided a great foundation for understanding VR development.  It gave me a lot of insight into the considerations you have to make for a VR experience that aren't necessary in normal game development. Significantly more thought has to be put into features like player movement and the design of the user interface.
## Features
- Supports full freedom of movement (6DoF)
- Choose between smooth movement and teleportation
- Grab object from a distance or up close
- Puzzles to solve!
## Unimplemented Features
- Move from Oculus integration to Unity XR kit
- Add more rooms
- Add more puzzles
## Challenges
There are many compatibility issues with different versions of Unity and the Oculus integration package that lead to things breaking. It was a challenge to find a combination of versions that worked well together. One of the biggest challenges was a lack of available information on VR development in general.
